# React Flow DAG Example

This project is a React application that utilizes the React Flow library to create and visualize directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using customizable nodes and edges. The layout of the graph is managed using the Dagre library for automatic positioning of nodes.

## Features

- Customizable node types (Root, Branch, Leaf)
- Automatic layout using Dagre
- Prevent deletion of edges
- MiniMap for better navigation
- Background grid for easier visualization

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vineet-javadev/sample_tree_structure.git
    cd sample_tree_structure
    npm install 

 ## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Components
### Node Types
- **Root Node:** Represented in red
- **Branch Node:** Represented in orange
- **Leaf Node:** Represented in yellow

## Layout
The layout of nodes is automatically managed by the Dagre library, which positions nodes based on their relationships defined by edges.

## Prevent Edge Deletion
The application is designed to prevent the deletion of edges, ensuring the integrity of the graph structure.

## Customization
You can customize the node types and their styles by modifying the nodeTypes object in the Home component. You can also change the layout direction by using the onLayout function.
